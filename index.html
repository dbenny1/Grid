                    and the subjects I learned were current, if not 
                    more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel 
                    I got every penny's worth.

                <p class="content">"I was an EMT for many years before I 
                    joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition 
                    and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
                    I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly 
                    fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks waas the 
                    best - most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the 
                    course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software 
                    Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                experiences was easy.</p>
                <p class="content">"The staff seemed genuinely concerned about my progress 
                    which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary

                <p class="content gray">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written 
                    a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can 
                    help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by 
                    a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the 
                    program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were 
                    very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile 
                    team project, in particular, was outstanding. It tokk my learning to the 
                    next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. Infact, I've 
                    often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development 
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer 
                    after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
